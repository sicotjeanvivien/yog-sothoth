//! Signal domain model.
//!
//! A signal is a *conclusion* emitted by a [`SignalDetector`] when a
//! condition on the observed data becomes true — not a raw on-chain
//! event. Its shape is uniform across protocols, so it lives in a single
//! generic table (`signals`), discriminated by `detector` + `protocol`.
//! Pure domain type; no persistence backend leaks in here.
//!
